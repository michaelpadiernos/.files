Mankind is on the edge of extinction as a new dominant, mindless opponent scours the landscape in search of food, which just so happens to be noninfected humans. This book follows the journey of Michael Talbot; his wife Tracy; and their three kids, Nicole, Justin, and Travis. Accompanying them are Brendon, Nicole's fiancé and former Wal-Mart door greeter, and Tommy, who may be more than he seems. Together they struggle against a ruthless, relentless enemy that has singled them out above all others. <\/p> <p>The Talbots have escaped Little Turtle, but to what end? For, on the run, they find themselves encountering a far vaster evil than the one that has already beset them. As they travel across the war-torn countryside they soon learn that there are more than just zombies to be fearful of: With law and order a long-distant memory, some humans have decided to take any and all matters into their own hands. Can the Talbots come through unscathed, or will they suffer the fate of so many countless millions before them? <\/p> <p>It's not just brains versus brain-eaters anymore.

Now Fortress Britain is the last bastion of the living - with 50 million beleaguered survivors facing down a world of seven billion animated corpses. And one international team of elite special operators - supremely trained and armed, always the most skilled, resolved, and unstoppable amongst us - are humanity's last best hope for survival.... <\/p> <p>Book Two - <i>Mogadishu of the Dead<\/i>: Alpha team is tasked with one last desperate operation: They must cross the Atlantic aboard the world's only remaining supercarrier and insert by air into the very middle of a dead continent, all in search of a rumored vaccine that might bring humanity back from the brink. But their op goes dangerously wrong from the start, with the team scattered to hell and back, and their target site a dry hole. Now they must fight their way on foot through a city of three million ravening dead guys, in search of an underground bunker that might hold the Last Man on Earth. But these undead will not be like any Zulus they have ever fought before - and they surround the new target in a writhing ring of death 30 feet high on all sides.... <\/p> <p>Book Three - <i>Three Parts Dead<\/i>: Alpha team, the world's best and last surviving Tier-1 operators, are adrift on Lake Michigan - and fast drifting into what looks like a damned hostile shoreline. Deep in the National Forest nearby, a former police officer and survivalist battles to keep her family alive - and tries to decide whether the commandos of Alpha are more dangerous to her alive or dead. Meanwhile, the John F. Kennedy, the world's last floating supercarrier, is run aground off the coast of Virginia - and facing a veritable hurricane of the dead, blowing in fast. Finally, back in Fortress Britain, the terrible outbreak from the Channel Tunnel turns out not to have been so contained after all.<\/p>","author":"Michael Stephen Fuchs, Glynn James","image_url":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51lzZ1fU7gL._SL500_.jpg","title_short":"Arisen Omnibus Edition: Books 1-3","rating_count":"6652","download_link":"https://cds.audible.com/download?asin=B00QSFC5QS&cust_id=ndJAMYSgRxlk5_JgDIi7Yi2MB88SFFgP5321Rno9hdtXW6_9fGCzh6c-Vo7yXA&codec=LC_64_22050_stereo&source=audible_iPhone&type=AUDI&encryptParams=LY27WDguXlo1Ffiv-pQ8HPw4K_SKCNrVWmE7IniqOJftb5IoyaTmTBrKs6n6akg_WDdTzwMiH88ep0cizI5W2ybXJi_dnY75n_MUmp0rSrkRE1OOcn8TPS_4uCRSPGJ42Ck1MwjsoaMzlsWED0p46nsy4PHPdHWzhc6MGgW7bO5m0rDY","filename":"Arisen Omnibus Edition- Books 1-3","release_date":"2014-12-19","user_id":"amzn1.account.AH36LR4NLVYTQFY3C2CQCATVAMDA","ayce":"false","publisher":"Podium Audio","files":[{"path":"Arisen Omnibus Edition- Books 1-3.jpg","kind":"image","type":"ART"}],"asin":"B00QSFC5QS","region":"US","purchase_date":"2015-05-01"},{"rating_average":"4.3880161440546415","chapters":[{"start_offset_ms":0,"chapters":[{"start_offset_ms":29138,"length_ms":1578286,"title":"Chapter 1","start_offset_sec":29},{"start_offset_ms":1607424,"length_ms":2178264,"title":"Chapter 2","start_offset_sec":1607},{"start_offset_ms":3785688,"length_ms":2081297,"title":"Chapter 3","start_offset_sec":3786},{"start_offset_ms":5866985,"length_ms":1140889,"title":"Chapter 4","start_offset_sec":5867},{"start_offset_ms":7007874,"length_ms":1590938,"title":"Chapter 5","start_offset_sec":7008},{"start_offset_ms":8598812,"length_ms":1130022,"title":"Chapter 6","start_offset_sec":8599},{"start_offset_ms":9728834,"length_ms":1937612,"title":"Chapter 7","start_offset_sec":9729}],"length_ms":29138,"title":"Phase One","start_offset_sec":0},{"start_offset_ms":11666446,"chapters":[{"start_offset_ms":11669446,"length_ms":1696794,"title":"Chapter 8","start_offset_sec":11669},{"start_offset_ms":13366240,"length_ms":1183800,"title":"Chapter 9","start_offset_sec":13366},{"start_offset_ms":14550040,"length_ms":1802333,"title":"Chapter 10","start_offset_sec":14550},{"start_offset_ms":16352373,"length_ms":1961993,"title":"Chapter 11","start_offset_sec":16352},{"start_offset_ms":18314366,"length_ms":1463647,"title":"Chapter 12","start_offset_sec":18314},{"start_offset_ms":19778013,"length_ms":1684701,"title":"Chapter 13","start_offset_sec":19778},{"start_offset_ms":21462714,"length_ms":2507430,"title":"Chapter 14","start_offset_sec":21463},{"start_offset_ms":23970144,"length_ms":1517238,"title":"Chapter 15","start_offset_sec":23970},{"start_offset_ms":25487382,"length_ms":2159316,"title":"Chapter 16","start_offset_sec":25487},{"start_offset_ms":27646698,"length_ms":2064254,"title":"Chapter 17","start_offset_sec":27647},{"start_offset_ms":29710952,"length_ms":1709546,"title":"Chapter 18","start_offset_sec":29711},{"start_offset_ms":31420498,"length_ms":2143016,"title":"Chapter 19","start_offset_sec":31420},{"start_offset_ms":33563514,"length_ms":1190951,"title":"Chapter 20","start_offset_sec":33564},{"start_offset_ms":34754465,"length_ms":1865863,"title":"Chapter 21","start_offset_sec":34754}],"length_ms":3000,"title":"Phase Two","start_offset_sec":11666},{"start_offset_ms":36620328,"chapters":[{"start_offset_ms":36623328,"length_ms":2061951,"title":"Chapter 22","start_offset_sec":36623},{"start_offset_ms":38685279,"length_ms":786739,"title":"Chapter 23","start_offset_sec":38685},{"start_offset_ms":39472018,"length_ms":457294,"title":"Chapter 24","start_offset_sec":39472},{"start_offset_ms":39929312,"length_ms":1165177,"title":"Chapter 25","start_offset_sec":39929},{"start_offset_ms":41094489,"length_ms":818411,"title":"Chapter 26","start_offset_sec":41094}],"length_ms":3000,"title":"Phase Three","start_offset_sec":36620},{"start_offset_ms":41912900,"length_ms":596474,"title":"Epilogue","start_offset_sec":41913},{"start_offset_ms":42509374,"length_ms":149815,"title":"End Credits","start_offset_sec":42509}],"abridged":"false","description":"<p>Zack Lightman has never much cared for reality.

the Realm. Vaelin Al Sorna was only a child of 10 when his father left him at the iron gate of the Sixth Order. The Brothers of the Sixth Order are devoted to battle, and Vaelin will be trained and hardened to the austere, celibate, and dangerous life of a Warrior of the Faith. He has no family now save the Order. <\/p> <p>Vaelin\u2019s father was Battle Lord to King Janus, ruler of the unified realm. Vaelin\u2019s rage at being deprived of his birthright and dropped at the doorstep of the Sixth Order like a foundling knows no bounds. He cherishes the memory of his mother, and what he will come to learn of her at the Order will confound him. His father, too, has motives that Vaelin will come to understand. But one truth overpowers all the rest: Vaelin Al Sorna is destined for a future he has yet to comprehend. A future that will alter not only the realm, but the world.<\/p>","author":"Anthony Ryan","image_url":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61r5rSnwAOL._SL500_.jpg","title_short":"Blood

Through decades of music by one of the best-selling musicians of all time, who created classics like \"Fire and Rain\" and \"Carolina in My Mind\", James Taylor has doled out his history in the poetry of his work. Taylor says his early life is, \"the source of many of my songs\", and <i>Break Shot<\/i> is a tour of his first 21 years in rich, new detail. Praised by Forbes magazine as going \"beyond the spoken word\", <i>Break Shot <\/i>combines storytelling, music and performance to create a one-of-a-kind listening experience. Longtime fans will savor a crop of musical gems, including an unreleased recording of the beloved hymn \"Jerusalem\", selections from his newest release <i>American Standard<\/i>, as well as new original scoring by Taylor specially recorded for <i>Break Shot<\/i> and more from the Grammy Award-winning artist.<\/p> <p>Recorded in his home studio, The Barn in western Massachusetts, Taylor tells the deeply personal story of his youth, which is entwined with the story of his family. What started as an idyllic tight unit soon became a family sent to different emotional corners - like a break shot in the game of pool, he says, when you slam the cue ball into the fifteen other balls and they all go flying off. By the time Taylor released his breakout second album in 1970, <i>Sweet Baby James<\/i>, he had seen the disintegration of his parents\u2019 marriage and his family crumble in the aftermath. He had committed himself twice to a psychiatric hospital, battled depression, a heroin addiction, suffered a relapse, and traveled far away from the wood smoke and moonshine of the North Carolina landscapes in which he came of age. Despite it all, he was also on the cusp of super-stardom and on his way to bringing light and joy to millions. He was 21.<\/p> <p>Journey with James Taylor to a time before he became a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Songwriters Hall of Fame inductee, a recipient of the Kennedy Center Honors and both the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the National Medal of Arts -

Why are you captivated by the writing of particular authors? How can you craft sentences that reflect your unique outlook on the world? <\/p> <p>This lively, 24-lecture course introduces you to the myriad ways in which we think about, talk about, and write sentences. Reviving the sentence-oriented approach to studying writing, Professor Landon provides a greater context for what makes sentences great - and how you can apply these methods to your own writing.<\/p> <p>You'll look at the kernels from which sentences grow - minimal base clauses - and how adding words or phrases creates larger, cumulative sentences that lead toward great writing. You'll explore sentence constructions that make writing more complex and add exciting levels of suspense, and see tactics that create balance and rhythm.Recognizing and appreciating these and other eye-opening aspects of sentences helps you understand the work that goes into creating an effective, pleasurable sentence, which can make you more aware of why particular lines, passages, or phrases in the poems, novels, or articles you read so enchant you. <\/p> <p>Professor Landon draws abundantly on examples from the work of brilliant writers, including Don DeLillo, Virginia Woolf, Samuel Johnson, and more. With its passionate approach to writing and reading and its indulgence in the sheer joy of language, this journey gives you unique insights into the nature of great writing-and also teaches you how you can achieve some of this greatness yourself.<\/p>","author":"Brooks Landon, The Great Courses","image_url":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/418Pxl7n+WL._SL500_.jpg","title_short":"Building Great Sentences: Exploring the Writer's Craft","rating_count":"796","download_link":"https://cds.audible.com/download?asin=B00DB6PQWW&cust_id=UFBelFNpaWFaZxiwGSdOoDH3hYuqYg6Ak0LfBDNz6n-JyYZ4MnqSjEgI2pltWA&codec=LC_64_22050_stereo&source=audible_iPhone&type=AUDI&encryptParams=mpllhzOYW5oW87vn9veRn5gAhFmFD0QVwtLVQb1StL45zAhB-iO2UcODmNyumyxG_KLr4LRtnpQghck68NIif7EinL6HDkfil2lTSkcCcS6SBIhfdLYuYs1vFmv_cpQfYkwHDc4vyN7wn6BHXURUgdUt0FrKFPaPDDm9-HShPF4U8lhw","filename":"Building Great Sentences- Exploring the Writer's Craft","release_date":"2013-07-08","user_id":"amzn1.account.AH36LR4NLVYTQFY3C2CQCATVAMDA","ayce":"false","publisher":"The Great Courses","files":[{"path":"Building Great Sentences- Exploring the Writer's Craft.jpg","kind":"image","type":"ART"}],"asin":"B00DB6PQWW","region":"US","purchase_date":"2015-09-14"},{"rating_average":"4.310291858678956","chapters":[{"start_offset_ms":0,"length_ms":155248,"title":"Chapter 1","start_offset_sec":0},{"start_offset_ms":155248,"length_ms":1199404,"title":"Chapter 2","start_offset_sec":155},{"start_offset_ms":1354652,"length_ms":1600041,"title":"Chapter 3","start_offset_sec":1355},{"start_offset_ms":2954693,"length_ms":932792,"title":"Chapter 4","start_offset_sec":2955},{"start_offset_ms":3887485,"length_ms":1042808,"title":"Chapter 5","start_offset_sec":3887},{"start_offset_ms":4930293,"length_ms":1502517,"title":"Chapter 6","start_offset_sec":4930},{"start_offset_ms":6432810,"length_ms":812141,"title":"Chapter 7","start_offset_sec":6433},{"start_offset_ms":7244951,"length_ms":1519375,"title":"Chapter 8","start_offset_sec":7245},{"start_offset_ms":8764326,"length_ms":1134713,"title":"Chapter 9","start_offset_sec":8764},{"start_offset_ms":9899039,"length_ms":190125,"title":"Chapter 10","start_offset_sec":9899},{"start_offset_ms":10089164,"length_ms":1820444,"title":"Chapter 11","start_offset_sec":10089},{"start_offset_ms":11909608,"length_ms":1294466,"title":"Chapter 12","start_offset_sec":11910},{"start_offset_ms":13204074,"length_ms":689633,"title":"Chapter 13","start_offset_sec":13204},{"start_offset_ms":13893707,"length_ms":903117,"title":"Chapter 14","start_offset_sec":13894},{"start_offset_ms":14796824,"length_ms":782327,"title":"Chapter 15","start_offset_sec":14797},{"start_offset_ms":15579151,"length_ms":581288,"title":"Chapter 16","start_offset_sec":15579}],"series_link":"/series/Furry-United-Coalition-Audiobook/B0141MS0U4","abridged":"false","description":"What's a poor bear to do when all he wants is some sweet, bunny pie....","read_status":"Finished","language":"english","title":"Bunny and the Bear","info_link":"https://www.audible.com/pd/B00YAZW7FW","duration":"04:29:00","author_link":"https://www.audible.com/author/Eve+Langlais/B003TL84VY","seconds":16140,"narrated_by":"Abby Craden","product_id":"BK_ADBL_023443","genre":"Erotica:Literature & Fiction:Romantic","series_name":"Furry United Coalition","series_sequence":"1","key":"BK_ADBL_023443","summary":"<p>Warning: A sense of humor is required for this tongue in cheek, paranormal romance. It contains coarse language and explicit sexual situation meant for open minded adults. Please note, that while no bunnies were permanently harmed in the making of this story, the prognosis isn't so good for the pie. <\/p> <p>What's a poor bear to do when all he wants is some sweet, bunny pie? <\/p> <p>Bears and bunnies aren't supposed to mix, or that's what Chase keeps telling himself when his bouncy new neighbor won't stay out of his business - and his mind. However, the more he gets to know his overly perky neighbor, the more he craves her. It's a desire worse than his addiction to honey and pie. <\/p> <p>Miranda's on a mission for the Furry United Coalition, and it involves secretly guarding one grumpy ol' bear. Staying focused on the job isn't easy when all she can think about is turning his frown upside down, a task made harder when she gets a glimpse of his passion. When she hears about his theory on woodland creatures and predators not mixing, she thinks all is lost.

Hide something behind smoke and mirrors and make people work to find it, and they'll tear the place down looking for what's there. Alex Verus is a diviner who can see probable futures-a talent that's gotten him out of many a tough scrape. But this time, he may be in over his head. Alex was once apprenticed to a Dark mage, and in his service he did a lot of things he isn't proud of.

Zombies are an ever-present danger, opportunistic humans threaten their very lives, and scabs are evolving into apex predators, with humans on the menu. <\/p> <p>As if the near impossibility of making it past all of these obstacles wasn't enough, Christian strives to search for his family. Did his parents or sister survive? And if they did, are any of them immune like him? His desire to find out what happened to them puts the entire mission in jeopardy. And what he discovers is that knowing is sometimes worse than not knowing. <\/p> <p>With new friends, enemies, and dreadful discoveries, the companions will have to pull all stops and endure more pain and hardship than ever before. Christian learns to love, hate, kill, and nurture, all while trying to hold on to some semblance of humanity. <\/p> <p>Is the road too dark and perilous for the fellowship to travel? Does Christian find his family? What new horrors will be revealed by the ever evolving Monostrovis Virus? To find answers to these questions and more, join Christian, Fish, Boomer, and the rest of the motley crew on their crusade! <\/p>","author":"J.D.

He fought for 23 days in Normandy, nearly 80 in Holland, 39 in Bastogne, and nearly 30 more in and near Haguenau, France, and the Ruhr pocket in Germany. <\/p> <p>This is his dramatic tale of those bloody days fighting his way from the shores of France to the heartland of Germany, and the epic story of how an adventurous kid from Oregon became a leader of men.<\/p>","author":"Don Malarkey, Bob Welch","image_url":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61NTuvyYWNL._SL500_.jpg","title_short":"Easy Company Soldier","rating_count":"856","download_link":"https://cds.audible.com/download?asin=B002V5GWOU&cust_id=OKSy1D4UGOXYBAKjXBRfI5ndCOVy8WkXK_1d3YYIYsq3MB2alrwRH6qpmL7Fhw&codec=LC_64_22050_stereo&source=audible_iPhone&type=AUDI&encryptParams=7xa6DDgEk28CLcp4Z0-bN_jZcZQ_wMrnLxj46W4WgqumNTdshdZoD7PA5acndx9dDMYqxgdizuWAVPSFbjG5T2F75ShIiqXYHhelCHKKtfBDKdBxWeJIial5cvxAofa9S4P8dGRxFeoN2kcngEY303DoMc2-SBbo6_WRk42hufrxDgMC","filename":"Easy Company Soldier","release_date":"2008-05-12","user_id":"amzn1.account.AH36LR4NLVYTQFY3C2CQCATVAMDA","ayce":"false","publisher":"Macmillan Audio","files":[{"path":"Easy Company Soldier.jpg","kind":"image","type":"ART"}],"asin":"B002V5GWOU","region":"US","purchase_date":"2024-01-05"},{"rating_average":"4.800152749490835","chapters":[{"start_offset_ms":0,"length_ms":443361,"title":"Prologue","start_offset_sec":0},{"start_offset_ms":443361,"length_ms":3354076,"title":"Chapter 1","start_offset_sec":443},{"start_offset_ms":3797437,"length_ms":838194,"title":"Chapter 2","start_offset_sec":3797},{"start_offset_ms":4635631,"length_ms":5351967,"title":"Chapter 3","start_offset_sec":4636},{"start_offset_ms":9987598,"length_ms":1873479,"title":"Chapter 4","start_offset_sec":9988},{"start_offset_ms":11861077,"length_ms":6209620,"title":"Chapter 5","start_offset_sec":11861},{"start_offset_ms":18070697,"length_ms":2343915,"title":"Chapter 6","start_offset_sec":18071},{"start_offset_ms":20414612,"length_ms":1661945,"title":"Chapter 7","start_offset_sec":20415},{"start_offset_ms":22076557,"length_ms":5010773,"title":"Chapter 8","start_offset_sec":22077},{"start_offset_ms":27087330,"length_ms":2172645,"title":"Chapter 9","start_offset_sec":27087},{"start_offset_ms":29259975,"length_ms":1175023,"title":"Chapter 10","start_offset_sec":29260},{"start_offset_ms":30434998,"length_ms":2844119,"title":"Chapter 11","start_offset_sec":30435},{"start_offset_ms":33279117,"length_ms":335621,"title":"Chapter 12","start_offset_sec":33279},{"start_offset_ms":33614738,"length_ms":787017,"title":"Chapter 13","start_offset_sec":33615},{"start_offset_ms":34401755,"length_ms":1030269,"title":"Chapter 14","start_offset_sec":34402},{"start_offset_ms":35432024,"length_ms":3168270,"title":"Chapter 15","start_offset_sec":35432},{"start_offset_ms":38600294,"length_ms":277060,"title":"Epilogue One","start_offset_sec":38600},{"start_offset_ms":38877354,"length_ms":1061941,"title":"Epilogue Two or Talbotsode 1","start_offset_sec":38877}],"series_link":"/series/Zombie-Fallout-Audiobook/B007PL93BE","abridged":"false","description":"<p>Getting to Etna Station is all that matters.

There's a werewolf with pre-lunar tension in the city, and a dwarf with attitude and a golem who's begun to think for itself, but that's just ordinary trouble.

Since the no-nonsense literary detective from Swindon made her debut, literature has never been quite the same. Neither have nursery rhymes, for that matter. With two successful books of the Nursery Crime series under his belt, Fforde once again takes up the brilliant adventures of his signature creation in the highly anticipated fifth installment of the Thursday Next series. And it's better than ever. <p> It's been 14 years since Thursday pegged out at the 1988 SuperHoop, and Friday is now a difficult 16-year-old. However, Thursday's got bigger problems. Sherlock Holmes is killed at the Rheinback Falls and his series is stopped in its tracks. And before this can be corrected, Miss Marple dies suddenly in a car accident, bringing her series to a close as well. When Thursday receives a death threat clearly intended for her written self, she realizes what's going on: there is a serial killer on the loose in the Bookworld. And that's not all: The Goliath Corporation is trying to deregulate book travel.<\/p> <p> Packed with word play, bizarre and entertaining subplots, and old-fashioned suspense, Thursday's return is sure to be celebrated by Jasper's fanatical fans and the critics who have loved him since the beginning.<\/p>","author":"Jasper Fforde","image_url":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41FtfKOOvlL._SL500_.jpg","title_short":"First Among Sequels","rating_count":"1199","download_link":"https://cds.audible.com/download?asin=B002VAES0A&cust_id=_1JuxPdGZA--gZVojchSD7kvz2A4jGhXvLbEMVeZmm7vL2SI-nzCgOVz8KtzzA&codec=LC_64_22050_stereo&source=audible_iPhone&type=AUDI&encryptParams=e6rFKKO_h60MDi7UlURveaNh5ITdWfHEdd1vaerMdZFMWR7BBtbF6rq_o1RTzY_yCiH-z05swaknikd8Ihgg23sFicnkgyiyp-Z_26SVkIV5HEQtBJmwzkQZBn1Un0ECBqgipVfXQfuaW_fJG_RSY_PLJK8w5B9kLQmeBzEwE96qiCOT","filename":"First Among Sequels - A Thursday Next Novel","release_date":"2007-08-02","user_id":"amzn1.account.AH36LR4NLVYTQFY3C2CQCATVAMDA","ayce":"false","publisher":"Recorded Books","files":[{"path":"First Among Sequels - A Thursday Next Novel.jpg","kind":"image","type":"ART"}],"asin":"B002VAES0A","region":"US","purchase_date":"2014-05-05"},{"rating_average":"4.594419870704321","chapters":[{"start_offset_ms":0,"length_ms":13043,"title":"Opening Credits","start_offset_sec":0},{"start_offset_ms":13043,"length_ms":32288853,"title":"Flowers for Algernon","start_offset_sec":13},{"start_offset_ms":32301896,"length_ms":34817,"title":"End Credits","start_offset_sec":32302}],"abridged":"false","description":"Charlie Gordon knows that he isn't very bright.

Meanwhile, each day Charlie keeps a diary of what is happening to him.

The mail is delivered promptly; meetings start and end on time; five out of six letters relegated to the Blind Letter Office ultimately wend their way to the correct addresses. Postmaster General Moist von Lipwig, former arch-swindler and confidence man, has exceeded all expectations: including his own. So it's somewhat disconcerting when Lord Vetinari summons Moist to the palace and asks, \"Tell me, Mr. Lipwig, would you like to make some real money?\" <p>Vetinari isn't talking about wages, of course. He's referring, rather, to the Royal Mint of Ankh-Morpork, a venerable institution that has run for centuries on the hereditary employment of the Men of the Sheds and their loyal outworkers, who do make money in their spare time. Unfortunately, it costs more than a penny to make a penny, so the whole process seems somewhat counterintuitive.<\/p> <p>Next door, at the Royal Bank, the Glooper, an \"analogy machine\", has scientifically established that one never has quite as much money at the end of the week as one thinks one should, and the bank's chairman, one elderly Topsy (née Turvy) Lavish, keeps two loaded crossbows at her desk. Oh, and the chief clerk is probably a vampire.<\/p> <p>But before Moist has time to fully consider Vetinari's question, fate answers it for him. Now he's not only making money, but enemies too; he's got to spring a prisoner from jail, break into his own bank vault, stop the new manager from licking his face, and, above all, find out where all the gold has gone: otherwise, his life in banking, while very exciting, is going to be really, really short.<\/p>","author":"Terry Pratchett","image_url":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61YrVDkIMaL._SL500_.jpg","title_short":"Making Money","rating_count":"4306","filename":"Making Money","download_link":"https://cds.audible.com/download?asin=B002V0Q7KE&cust_id=HBVoRx-i9_ExhqywPm1jz3vwQQeq3vQUVKMzJnuSW9gkKPtggBySaLTHa-9gdQ&codec=LC_64_22050_stereo&source=audible_iPhone&type=AUDI&encryptParams=Q0O4qL_EFfsFJ3E0kDtSsgRRpgtKm4NTzmZ-0uAN6ZWaJoOmZPf7roa1NJjeKnFZFJJneX-biNNpdp0ZyQ3ppVfCjaUmM428RsEW0qUxxibjPTkslrJGFmjelbrYLGe6YIkOh8rFd8A6BgWWDGya6lO5PH49V038frSv7V6Gaqg6O31P","release_date":"2007-09-10","user_id":"amzn1.account.AH36LR4NLVYTQFY3C2CQCATVAMDA","ayce":"false","publisher":"HarperAudio","files":[{"path":"Making Money.jpg","kind":"image","type":"ART"},{"path":"Making Money.m4b","kind":"audio","type":"M4B"}],"asin":"B002V0Q7KE","region":"US","purchase_date":"2016-03-23"},{"copyright":"©2007 Terry Pratchett ℗2023 HarperCollins Publishers","rating_average":"4.8465608465608465","chapters":[{"start_offset_ms":0,"length_ms":112198,"title":"Opening Credits","start_offset_sec":0},{"start_offset_ms":112198,"length_ms":65108,"title":"Author\u2019s Note","start_offset_sec":112},{"start_offset_ms":177306,"length_ms":3957609,"title":"Chapter 1","start_offset_sec":177},{"start_offset_ms":4134915,"length_ms":2962216,"title":"Chapter 2","start_offset_sec":4135},{"start_offset_ms":7097131,"length_ms":3437203,"title":"Chapter 3","start_offset_sec":7097},{"start_offset_ms":10534334,"length_ms":3402652,"title":"Chapter 4","start_offset_sec":10534},{"start_offset_ms":13936986,"length_ms":2137443,"title":"Chapter 4, continued","start_offset_sec":13937},{"start_offset_ms":16074429,"length_ms":4235784,"title":"Chapter 5","start_offset_sec":16074},{"start_offset_ms":20310213,"length_ms":2826704,"title":"Chapter 6","start_offset_sec":20310},{"start_offset_ms":23136917,"length_ms":2842215,"title":"Chapter 6, continued","start_offset_sec":23137},{"start_offset_ms":25979132,"length_ms":4069529,"title":"Chapter 7","start_offset_sec":25979},{"start_offset_ms":30048661,"length_ms":2243140,"title":"Chapter 8","start_offset_sec":30049},{"start_offset_ms":32291801,"length_ms":3320314,"title":"Chapter 9","start_offset_sec":32292},{"start_offset_ms":35612115,"length_ms":2683576,"title":"Chapter 10","start_offset_sec":35612},{"start_offset_ms":38295691,"length_ms":2089331,"title":"Chapter 11","start_offset_sec":38296},{"start_offset_ms":40385022,"length_ms":2215462,"title":"Chapter 12","start_offset_sec":40385},{"start_offset_ms":42600484,"length_ms":3364803,"title":"Chapter 13","start_offset_sec":42600},{"start_offset_ms":45965287,"length_ms":301116,"title":"Epilogue","start_offset_sec":45965},{"start_offset_ms":46266403,"length_ms":41237,"title":"End Credits","start_offset_sec":46266}],"series_link":"/pd/Discworld-Audiobook/B006K1LRQO","abridged":"false","read_status":"Unread","description":"<p>The Royal Bank of Ankh-Morpork is facing a crisis, and who better to manage it than the man who turned around Ankh-Morpork\u2019s inefficient Post Office, former arch-swindler-turned-Postmaster General Moist von Lipwig. <\/p>","language":"english","title":"Making Money - A Discworld Novel","info_link":"https://www.audible.com/pd/B0C6R8YYL1","duration":"12:51:00","author_link":"https://www.audible.com/author/Terry+Pratchett/B000AQ0NN8","seconds":46260,"narrated_by":"Richard Coyle, Bill Nighy, Peter Serafinowicz","product_id":"BK_HARP_015815","genre":"Science Fiction & Fantasy:Fantasy:Humorous","series_name":"Discworld","series_sequence":"36","key":"BK_HARP_015815","summary":"<p><b>\u201cOutlandish fun. . . . <\/b><b><i>Making Money<\/i><\/b><b> balances satire, knockabout farce and close observation of human\u2014and non-human\u2014foibles with impressive dexterity and deceptive ease.

With the narrative power of fiction, Donald Miller takes you on a harrowing ride through the fire-filled skies over Berlin, Hanover, and Dresden and describes the terrible cost of bombing for the German people.<\/p> <p>Fighting at 25,000 feet in thin, freezing air that no warriors had ever encountered before, bomber crews battled new kinds of assaults on body and mind. Air combat was deadly but intermittent: periods of inactivity and anxiety were followed by short bursts of fire and fear. Unlike infantrymen, bomber boys slept on clean sheets, drank beer in local pubs, and danced to the swing music of Glenn Miller\u2019s Air Force band, which toured US air bases in England. But they had a much greater chance of dying than ground soldiers.<\/p> <p>The bomber crews were an elite group of warriors who were a microcosm of America\u2014white America, anyway. The actor Jimmy Stewart was a bomber boy, and so was the \u201cKing of Hollywood,\u201d Clark Gable. And the air war was filmed by Oscar-winning director William Wyler and covered by reporters like Andy Rooney and Walter Cronkite, all of whom flew combat missions with the men. The Anglo-American bombing campaign against Nazi Germany was the longest military campaign of World War II, a war within a war. Until Allied soldiers crossed into Germany in the final months of the war, it was the only battle fought inside the German homeland.<\/p> <p><i>Masters of the Air<\/i> is a story of life in wartime England and in the German prison camps, where tens of thousands of airmen spent part of the war. It ends with a vivid description of the grisly hunger marches captured airmen were forced to make near the end of the war through the country their bombs destroyed.<\/p> <p>Drawn from interviews, oral histories, and American, British, German, and other archives, <i>Masters of the Air <\/i>is an authoritative, deeply moving account of the world\u2019s first and only bomber war.<\/p>","author":"Donald L.

And, to no one's great surprise, the conflict centers around the small, insufferably arrogant, strictly fundamentalist duchy of Borogravia, which has long prided itself on its ability to beat up on its neighbors. This time, however, it's Borogravia that's getting its long-overdue comeuppance, which has left the country severely drained of young men. <p>Ever since her brother Paul marched off to battle a year ago, Polly Perks has been running The Duchess, her family's inn, even though the revered national deity, Nuggan, has decreed that female ownership of a business is an Abomination. To keep The Duchess in the family, Polly must find her missing sibling. So she cuts off her hair, dons masculine garb, and sets out to join him in this man's army.<\/p> <p>Polly is afraid that someone will see through her disguise; a fear that proves groundless when the legendary Sergeant Jackrum accepts her without question. Or perhaps the sergeant is too desperate to discriminate, which would explain why a vampire, a troll, a zombie, a religious fanatic, and two uncommonly close \"friends\" are also eagerly welcomed into the fighting fold. Soon, Polly finds herself wondering about the myriad peculiarities of her new brothers-in-arms. It would appear that Polly \"Ozzer\" Perks is not the only grunt with a secret.<\/p>","author":"Terry

When he returns home, he finds his wheat farm destroyed and a huge crater where the wheat once grew. And his diamond sword is missing! Steve believes it's the act of a griefer with a lot of TNT. Devastated, Steve wants to rebuild and find his sword, but with his wheat destroyed, he must call on old friends to help him. All together again, Lucy, Max, and Henry tell harrowing stories of their treasure hunts and conquests, and Steve discusses his strategy for rebuilding. They all go to sleep, excited to begin their plans; but when they wake up, Henry is missing! Looking for Henry in the village, two of Steve's neighbors, Kyra and Adam, have been targeted as well: Kyra's barn was flooded with lava, and Adam's friend Thomas is missing too! Who is the griefer terrorizing Steve and the villagers? And how will Steve find the resources to rebuild his prosperous farm? With suspicion circulating and no answers to be found, Steve finds himself wrongly suspected of these crimes - and so he must discover who the mischievous griefer is before something even worse happens.<\/p>","author":"Winter Morgan","image_url":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51r2yH8PzUL._SL500_.jpg","title_short":"Mystery of the Griefer's Mark","rating_count":"634","filename":"Mystery of the Griefer's Mark","download_link":"https://cds.audible.com/download?asin=B00PHF4YS2&cust_id=q-Otct5MP3Yt465qi_GcjMux8X8sA2QzLFFzEbj8yrx0poLagi_58Mwut5gJfg&codec=LC_64_22050_stereo&source=audible_iPhone&type=AUDI&encryptParams=1iVa6bndJTp9Qib2ivfwtOlSP04jRZ_zLI6FLMoViYGN3lthgNmVs5U5e5O6zORrzrI5SzUH_A9OsQSdU1YAZp9BOiPUOGr_SvdRr991Hn1h7A5JWgSo0l-dTnBUdgX4JbDkGHHUVqewgFwSypOJpI7DxMnVx5fYukLl54ZuHpk-hftg","release_date":"2014-11-25","user_id":"amzn1.account.AH36LR4NLVYTQFY3C2CQCATVAMDA","ayce":"true","publisher":"Audible Studios","files":[{"path":"Mystery of the Griefer's Mark.jpg","kind":"image","type":"ART"},{"path":"Mystery of the Griefer's Mark.m4b","kind":"audio","type":"M4B"}],"asin":"B00PHF4YS2","region":"US","purchase_date":"2020-08-26"},{"copyright":"©2013 Elliot Kay ℗2015 Audible, Inc.","rating_average":"4.554554554554555","chapters":[{"start_offset_ms":0,"length_ms":10942,"title":"Opening Credits","start_offset_sec":0},{"start_offset_ms":10942,"length_ms":1298291,"title":"Prologue","start_offset_sec":11},{"start_offset_ms":1309233,"length_ms":4756747,"title":"Chapter One: And It\u2019s Only Tuesday","start_offset_sec":1309},{"start_offset_ms":6065980,"length_ms":4165799,"title":"Chapter Two: Welcome to Our Madhouse","start_offset_sec":6066},{"start_offset_ms":10231779,"length_ms":2188387,"title":"Chapter Three: It\u2019s Worse Than It Looks","start_offset_sec":10232},{"start_offset_ms":12420166,"length_ms":5006733,"title":"Chapter Four: Due Diligence","start_offset_sec":12420},{"start_offset_ms":17426899,"length_ms":5742898,"title":"Chapter Five: Freaks Have More Fun","start_offset_sec":17427},{"start_offset_ms":23169797,"length_ms":3449556,"title":"Chapter Six: Party Fouls","start_offset_sec":23170},{"start_offset_ms":26619353,"length_ms":4222502,"title":"Chapter Seven: Blood Debts","start_offset_sec":26619},{"start_offset_ms":30841855,"length_ms":3769016,"title":"Chapter Eight: The After-Party","start_offset_sec":30842},{"start_offset_ms":34610871,"length_ms":5118978,"title":"Chapter Nine: The Bedroom of Misfit Toys","start_offset_sec":34611},{"start_offset_ms":39729849,"length_ms":6066445,"title":"Chapter Ten: It\u2019s Cheaper Than Therapy","start_offset_sec":39730},{"start_offset_ms":45796294,"length_ms":5589553,"title":"Chapter Eleven: Trust","start_offset_sec":45796},{"start_offset_ms":51385847,"length_ms":2938206,"title":"Chapter Twelve: Cuffed and Stuffed","start_offset_sec":51386},{"start_offset_ms":54324053,"length_ms":3905271,"title":"Chapter Thirteen: Extraordinary Measures","start_offset_sec":54324},{"start_offset_ms":58229324,"length_ms":3606105,"title":"Chapter Fourteen: Ugly","start_offset_sec":58229},{"start_offset_ms":61835429,"length_ms":2723329,"title":"Chapter Fifteen: Alea Iacta Est","start_offset_sec":61835},{"start_offset_ms":64558758,"length_ms":3727313,"title":"Chapter Sixteen: Shadows","start_offset_sec":64559},{"start_offset_ms":68286071,"length_ms":7649488,"title":"Chapter Seventeen: By the Sword","start_offset_sec":68286},{"start_offset_ms":75935559,"length_ms":4952007,"title":"Chapter Eighteen: Fallout","start_offset_sec":75936},{"start_offset_ms":80887566,"length_ms":27185,"title":"End Credits","start_offset_sec":80888}],"series_link":"/pd/Good-Intentions-Audiobook/B014VC08J0","abridged":"false","read_status":"Finished","description":"The exciting sequel to Good Intentions!

Times<\/i> best-selling books <i>World War Z<\/i> by Max Brooks and James Rollins\u2019 <i>Sigma Force<\/i> Series to kick off the start of a new series featuring Joe Ledger and the Department of Military Sciences. <\/p> <p>When you have to kill the same terrorist twice in one week there\u2019s either something wrong with your world or something wrong with your skills - and there\u2019s nothing wrong with Joe Ledger\u2019s skills. And that\u2019s both a good and a bad thing. It\u2019s good because he\u2019s a Baltimore detective who has just been secretly recruited by the government to lead a new task force created to deal with the problems that Homeland Security can\u2019t handle. This rapid-response group is called the Department of Military Sciences, or the DMS for short. It\u2019s bad because his first mission is to help stop a group of terrorists from releasing a dreadful bioweapon that can turn ordinary people into zombies. The fate of the world hangs in the balance. <\/p> <p>Jonathan Maberry is the <i>New York Times<\/i> best-selling and multiple Bram Stoker Award\u2013winning author of <i>Ghost Road Blues<\/i>, the first of a trilogy of thrillers with a supernatural bite.

Add in the less-than-sociable new neighbors only blocks away, and the hunt for sustenance has come to feel more like a race than a ramble. <\/p> <p>Sylvie is happy in her new home with the people who've become like family, though she's still working out how to let them into her heart. Eric wants in, and he wants to find his sister, but he can't do both at the same time.

The toy plane is the exact replica of the one flown by the war hero. Everyone laughs, thinking it's a prank or a publicity stunt. Until it explodes, killing dozens.<br /> <br /> Seconds later a swarm of killer drones descend upon the picnicked crowd, each one carrying a powerful bomb. All across the country artificial intelligence drive systems in cars, commuter trains and even fighter planes go out of control. The death toll soars as the machines we depend upon every day are turned into engines of destruction.<br /> <br /> Joe Ledger and the Department of Military Sciences go on the hunt for whoever is controlling these machines, but the every step of the way they are met with traps and shocks that strike to the very heart of the DMS. No one is safe. Nowhere is safe. Enemies old and new rise as America burns.<br /> <br /> Joe Ledger and his team are back in Jonathan Maberry's seventh book in the series. They begin a desperate search for the secret to this new technology and the madmen behind it. But before they can close in the enemy virus infects Air Force One. The president is trapped aboard as the jet heads toward the heart of New York City.

With the arrival of eligible young men in their neighbourhood, the lives of Mr and Mrs Bennet and their five daughters are turned inside out and upside down. Pride encounters prejudice, upward-mobility confronts social disdain, and quick-wittedness challenges sagacity, as misconceptions and hasty judgements lead to heartache and scandal, but eventually to true understanding, self-knowledge, and love. In this supremely satisfying story, Jane Austen balances comedy with seriousness, and witty observation with profound insight. If Elizabeth Bennet returns again and again to her letter from Mr Darcy, readers of the novel are drawn even more irresistibly by its captivating wisdom.<\/p>","author":"Jane

The Zombies have also turned the village blacksmith into a Zombie, leaving Steve without a place to get swords.

Nighttime is when users are most vulnerable in Minecraft. As he looks for shelter in a temple, he meets a trio of treasure hunters, Max, Lucy, and Henry, who are trying to unearth the treasure under the temple. Steve tells them of his master plan to mine for the most powerful mineral in the Overworld - the diamond. The treasure hunters are eager to join him. Facing treacherous mining conditions, a thunderstorm, and attacks from hostile mobs, these four friends question if it's better to be a single player than a multiplayer, as they try to watch out for each other and chase Steve's dream at the same time. Will Steve find the diamonds? Will his friends help or hinder the search? Should he trust his new treasure hunter friends? And will Steve get back in time to save the villagers?<\/p>","author":"Winter Morgan","image_url":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51tKBA2WnyL._SL500_.jpg","title_short":"Quest for the Diamond Sword","rating_count":"1485","filename":"Quest for the Diamond Sword - A Minecraft Gamer's Adventure","download_link":"https://cds.audible.com/download?asin=B00PHH1CY4&cust_id=xe4G_qeu5y8DJrt2saJele6Zaf1ca7voZbjKClltEsARjcuZKVQv_ZJ4xxgl0Q&codec=LC_64_22050_stereo&source=audible_iPhone&type=AUDI&encryptParams=QoAWIaw-a_KXp8Ee30Fe5Uq0PbwH0kV5EXhPo3Br8b7J_DpO7VG_O5LZFYlWawfh2_GRkSOZuCby2HWgXRCFEfRjINcqqYh9_JWdn8W4EN6u83JF8lDq2R9v_m_qDs1Uc2w4Sf9X_iY46TwDLcIopU6mox_bYi2aeo38R6zgiCcK_-ob","release_date":"2014-11-25","user_id":"amzn1.account.AH36LR4NLVYTQFY3C2CQCATVAMDA","ayce":"true","publisher":"Audible Studios","files":[{"path":"Quest for the Diamond Sword - A Minecraft Gamer's Adventure.jpg","kind":"image","type":"ART"},{"path":"Quest for the Diamond Sword - A Minecraft Gamer's Adventure.m4b","kind":"audio","type":"M4B"}],"asin":"B00PHH1CY4","region":"US","purchase_date":"2020-08-26"},{"copyright":"©2018 Richard Hummel ℗2019 Richard Hummel","rating_average":"4.109961190168176","chapters":[{"start_offset_ms":0,"length_ms":14163,"title":"Opening Credits","start_offset_sec":0},{"start_offset_ms":14163,"length_ms":1683353,"title":"Chapter 1","start_offset_sec":14},{"start_offset_ms":1697516,"length_ms":2599891,"title":"Chapter 2","start_offset_sec":1698},{"start_offset_ms":4297407,"length_ms":2156112,"title":"Chapter 3","start_offset_sec":4297},{"start_offset_ms":6453519,"length_ms":2096111,"title":"Chapter 4","start_offset_sec":6454},{"start_offset_ms":8549630,"length_ms":2039315,"title":"Chapter 5","start_offset_sec":8550},{"start_offset_ms":10588945,"length_ms":1723059,"title":"Chapter 6","start_offset_sec":10589},{"start_offset_ms":12312004,"length_ms":1716837,"title":"Chapter 7","start_offset_sec":12312},{"start_offset_ms":14028841,"length_ms":2101359,"title":"Chapter 8","start_offset_sec":14029},{"start_offset_ms":16130200,"length_ms":2191592,"title":"Chapter 9","start_offset_sec":16130},{"start_offset_ms":18321792,"length_ms":1819654,"title":"Chapter 10","start_offset_sec":18322},{"start_offset_ms":20141446,"length_ms":2005739,"title":"Chapter 11","start_offset_sec":20141},{"start_offset_ms":22147185,"length_ms":1917271,"title":"Chapter 12","start_offset_sec":22147},{"start_offset_ms":24064456,"length_ms":1378522,"title":"Chapter 13","start_offset_sec":24064},{"start_offset_ms":25442978,"length_ms":1593213,"title":"Chapter 14","start_offset_sec":25443},{"start_offset_ms":27036191,"length_ms":1940352,"title":"Chapter 15","start_offset_sec":27036},{"start_offset_ms":28976543,"length_ms":2096576,"title":"Chapter 16","start_offset_sec":28977},{"start_offset_ms":31073119,"length_ms":2394673,"title":"Chapter 17","start_offset_sec":31073},{"start_offset_ms":33467792,"length_ms":2380463,"title":"Chapter 18","start_offset_sec":33468},{"start_offset_ms":35848255,"length_ms":1939191,"title":"Chapter 19","start_offset_sec":35848},{"start_offset_ms":37787446,"length_ms":1205812,"title":"Chapter 20","start_offset_sec":37787},{"start_offset_ms":38993258,"length_ms":2831023,"title":"Chapter 21","start_offset_sec":38993},{"start_offset_ms":41824281,"length_ms":1676294,"title":"Chapter 22","start_offset_sec":41824},{"start_offset_ms":43500575,"length_ms":1620706,"title":"Chapter 23","start_offset_sec":43501},{"start_offset_ms":45121281,"length_ms":1725707,"title":"Chapter 24","start_offset_sec":45121},{"start_offset_ms":46846988,"length_ms":2564829,"title":"Chapter 25","start_offset_sec":46847},{"start_offset_ms":49411817,"length_ms":1918246,"title":"Chapter 26","start_offset_sec":49412},{"start_offset_ms":51330063,"length_ms":2345679,"title":"Chapter 27","start_offset_sec":51330},{"start_offset_ms":53675742,"length_ms":1970491,"title":"Chapter 28","start_offset_sec":53676},{"start_offset_ms":55646233,"length_ms":18482,"title":"End Credits","start_offset_sec":55646}],"abridged":"false","read_status":"Unread","description":"<p>Jared Cartwright grew up in a loving, caring community, completely isolated from the horrors of the outside world.

When both appear to be deserted by the young men they had intended to marry, the stage is set for a delicious comedy of manners that not only showcases Austen's perception, humor and incomparable prose, but offers a splendid glimpse of upper and middle-class English society of the early 18th century.<\/p>","author":"Jane

<\/b><b><i>New York Times<\/i><\/b><b> best-selling author Brandon Sanderson, the Mistborn series is a heist story of political intrigue and magical, martial-arts action.<\/b><\/p> <p>Three hundred years after the events of the Mistborn trilogy, Scadrial is now on the verge of modernity, with railroads to supplement the canals, electric lighting in the streets and the homes of the wealthy, and the first steel-framed skyscrapers racing for the clouds.<\/p> <p>When family obligations forced Waxillium Ladrian to forsake the frontier lands and return to the metropolis of his birth to take his place as head of a noble House, he little imagined that the crime-fighting skills acquired during 20 years in the dusty plains would be just as applicable in the big city. He soon learned that there, too, just being a talented Twinborn - one who can use both Allomancy and Feruchemy, the dominant magical modes on Scadrial - would not suffice. <\/p> <p>This bustling, optimistic, but still shaky society will now face its first test by terrorism and assassination, crimes intended to stir up labor strife and religious conflict. Wax, his eccentric sidekick, Wayne, and brilliant, beautiful young Marasi, now officially part of the constabulary, must unravel the conspiracy before civil strife can stop Scadrial\u2019s progress in its tracks. <\/p> <p>Other Tor books by Brandon Sanderson:<\/p> <ul> <li><i>The Cosmere<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Stormlight Archive<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Way of Kings<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Words of

Now, Nana Mora's eyesight is fading, and there's something she wants to show Eliza before it\u2019s totally gone: a mythical place locals refer to as Sirens Harbor. Supposedly hidden somewhere on the island, it's a place where all the mermaids in the world congregate once a year to sing their Winter Song. It's all fairy-tale silliness, according to Eliza's mom. But Nana Mora is convinced it's real. <\/p> <p>With the help of an eccentric lighthouse keeper, Nana and Eliza pack up their gear and set out on their journey. As they travel, Eliza hears the real story of Sirens Harbor...along with the story of a fearsome mermaid named Silverswift, a warrior-princess rumored to have walked on the islands. Challenges abound for the adventurers: old maps are hard to read, and treacherous trails spiral through the woods. And there's a strange storm spinning all around them. It's almost as if some things are meant to stay secret. As if the harbor doesn't want to be found. Or as if, maybe, someone doesn't want them to find it.... <\/p> <p>One thing is for sure: what Eliza and her grandmother actually discover on the night of the winter solstice will be better than any fairytale. As Nana Mora says: \"Some stories aren't fiction, my darling Eliza. Some stories are lifetimes.\" <\/p>","author":"Natalie Lloyd","image_url":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51vNU48y7OL._SL500_.jpg","title_short":"Silverswift","rating_count":"6630","download_link":"https://cds.audible.com/download?asin=B08B46CK1J&cust_id=xvV8sTGEO7axST1pPSfrsb4MuX4CT6Wov5i0cB1skvHB8DMAHutR6XvLJO2C8A&codec=LC_128_44100_stereo&source=audible_iPhone&type=AUDI&encryptParams=TueaUQqjKhH9m97WgUldhkpFaqlZhQxi8kzo_8E1ip0iEa4SaHCNTDGyZYWxqg7Y0MobSOXJjpuYzjzlVtJfDaHFZMZcVQskqAeTpCb3HrtlTepJQM_3mVEJl09MN8j63gYeXNAux5Mzn5QZN2qivucf0JkN2TbPzv3gkoErjM9DBRCH","filename":"Silverswift","release_date":"2020-07-02","user_id":"amzn1.account.AH36LR4NLVYTQFY3C2CQCATVAMDA","ayce":"false","publisher":"Audible Originals","files":[{"path":"Silverswift.jpg","kind":"image","type":"ART"}],"asin":"B08B46CK1J","region":"US","purchase_date":"2020-07-15"},{"copyright":"©1980 Moncalm Publishing Company;℗1994 Penguin-HighBridge Audio","rating_average":"4.006802721088436","chapters":[{"start_offset_ms":0,"length_ms":3955240,"title":"Chapter 1","start_offset_sec":0},{"start_offset_ms":3955240,"length_ms":4330986,"title":"Chapter 2","start_offset_sec":3955},{"start_offset_ms":8286226,"length_ms":4221713,"title":"Chapter 3","start_offset_sec":8286},{"start_offset_ms":12507939,"length_ms":4072687,"title":"Chapter 4","start_offset_sec":12508},{"start_offset_ms":16580626,"length_ms":2719521,"title":"Chapter 5","start_offset_sec":16581}],"abridged":"true","read_status":"Unread","description":"Four complete and unabridged selections from the electrifying bestseller read by a stellar group of narrators....","language":"english","title":"Skeleton Crew - Selections","info_link":"https://www.audible.com/pd/B002V9Z4M2","duration":"05:21:00","author_link":"https://www.audible.com/author/Stephen+King/B000AQ0842","seconds":19260,"narrated_by":"Matthew Broderick, Dana Ivey, Frances Sternhagen","product_id":"BK_PENG_001230","genre":"Literature & Fiction:Anthologies & Short Stories:Short Stories","key":"BK_PENG_001230","summary":"Four complete and unabridged selections from the electrifying best seller read by a stellar group of narrators. <p>\"The Raft\" is the unforgettable tale of an idyllic autumn swim suddenly transformed into an ordeal of unbridled horror.

America as it was is gone forever, and now every citizen - from the president of the United States to the homeless on the streets of New York City - will fight for survival. <\/p> <p><i>Swan Song<\/i> is Robert McCammon's prescient and shocking vision of a post-apocalyptic nation, a grand epic of terror and, ultimately, renewal. <\/p> <p>In a wasteland born of rage and fear, populated by monstrous creatures and marauding armies, earth's last survivors have been drawn into the final battle between good and evil, that will decide the fate of humanity.

Joshua Hutchins, the pro wrestler who takes refuge from the nuclear fallout at a Nebraska gas station... and Swan, a young girl possessing special powers, who travels alongside Josh to a Missouri town where healing and recovery can begin with Swan's gifts. But the ancient force behind earth's devastation is scouring the walking wounded for recruits for its relentless army, beginning with Swan herself. <\/p> <p><b>Please note: Two chapters were originally missing from Part 2 of this book.

Kelsier, Vin, Elend, Sazed, Spook, and the rest are now part of history - or religion. <\/p> <p>Yet even as science and technology are reaching new heights, the old magics of Allomancy and Feruchemy continue to play a role in this reborn world. Out in the frontier lands known as the Roughs, they are crucial tools for the brave men and women attempting to establish order and justice. One such is Waxillium Ladrian, a rare Twinborn, who can Push on metals with his Allomancy and use Feruchemy to become lighter or heavier at will. <\/p> <p>After 20 years in the Roughs, Wax has been forced by family tragedy to return to the metropolis of Elendel. Now he must reluctantly put away his guns and assume the duties and dignity incumbent upon the head of a noble house. Or so he thinks, until he learns the hard way that the mansions and elegant tree-lined streets of the city can be even more dangerous than the dusty plains of the Roughs. <\/p> <p>Other Tor books by Brandon Sanderson:<\/p> <p><\/p> <ul> <li><i>The Cosmere<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Stormlight Archive<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Way of Kings<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Words of Radiance<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Edgedancer <\/i>(Novella)<\/li> <li><i>Oathbringer <\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>The Mistborn trilogy:<\/p> <p><\/p> <ul> <li><i>Mistborn: The Final Empire<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Well of Ascension<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Hero of Ages<\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>Mistborn: The Wax and Wayne series:<\/p> <p><\/p> <ul> <li><i>Alloy of Law<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Shadows of Self<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Bands of Mourning<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Collection<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Arcanum Unbounded<\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>Other Cosmere novels:<\/p> <p><\/p> <ul> <li><i>Elantris<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Warbreaker<\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>The Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians series:<\/p> <p><\/p> <ul> <li><i>Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Scrivener's Bones<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Knights of Crystallia<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Shattered Lens<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Dark Talent<\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>The Rithmatist series:<\/p> <p><\/p> <ul> <li><i>The Rithmatist<\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>Other books by Brandon Sanderson:<\/p> <p><\/p> <ul> <li><i>The Reckoners<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Steelheart<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Firefight<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Calamity <\/i><\/li> <\/ul>","author":"Brandon Sanderson","image_url":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51VNzOolx+L._SL500_.jpg","title_short":"The Alloy of Law","rating_count":"40415","filename":"The Alloy of Law - A Mistborn Novel","download_link":"https://cds.audible.com/download?asin=B005ZUI3OA&cust_id=CLjpJZBfuMnRGAbMeLlMDreJqBdQRPJq-IwtGfQV8Gsgm22PDEi4uGa0w28O3Q&codec=LC_64_22050_stereo&source=audible_iPhone&type=AUDI&encryptParams=T4IcTyXyPu4cuqXIZkZxEzoou_6QzceuSPEXAoQBHEUrIPLASHznMFaAmG_-QGMjemdIJCxv89fKKpSL9mlaqWMsAKnRyCm2H3BXAyP4Wf55Rk-aDLQK4leW7dyJTMhSZco3NMZAfRhLs4ip2S3UZ7OKGgPHUYsqbKHziUFS760gf9ay","release_date":"2011-11-08","user_id":"amzn1.account.AH36LR4NLVYTQFY3C2CQCATVAMDA","ayce":"false","publisher":"Macmillan Audio","files":[{"path":"The Alloy of Law - A Mistborn Novel.jpg","kind":"image","type":"ART"},{"path":"The Alloy of Law - A Mistborn Novel.m4b","kind":"audio","type":"M4B"}],"asin":"B005ZUI3OA","region":"US","purchase_date":"2015-09-23"},{"copyright":"©2020 Christopher T Fox;℗2020 Christopher T Fox","rating_average":"4.769230769230769","chapters":[{"start_offset_ms":0,"length_ms":14628,"title":"Opening Credits","start_offset_sec":0},{"start_offset_ms":14628,"length_ms":874602,"title":"Previously On Deathless","start_offset_sec":15},{"start_offset_ms":889230,"length_ms":879757,"title":"Prologue","start_offset_sec":889},{"start_offset_ms":1768987,"length_ms":813859,"title":"1.

R. James.<\/p> <p><i>Casting the Runes<\/i> - adapted by Stephen Gallagher<\/p> <p>When academic Jo Harrington (Anna Maxwell Martin) is sent a paper - <i>The Truth of Alchemy<\/i>, by Anton Karswell - for peer review, she pulls no punches. It has no place in a serious academic publication, and Karswell is a half-bright fool. However, when the editor writes a rejection note to Karswell, he inadvertently includes her entire email. Occultist Karswell (Reece Shearsmith) doesn\u2019t take kindly to criticism. <\/p> <p>On the tube home with her partner Edward Dunning (Tom Burke), Jo spots a poster with her name on it. It reads: 'In memory of Joanne Harrington, M.Litt, PhD, died September eighteenth, three days were allowed.' Is there anything that Edward can do to save Jo from this curse? <\/p> <p><i>Lost Hearts<\/i> - adapted by A. K. Benedict<\/p> <p>Teenager Stephanie Elliot (Rosa Coduri) is taken to Aswarby House to be fostered by Mrs Bunch (Susan Jameson). Stephanie strikes up a friendship with Ben (Bill Milner), the adopted son of charismatic community leader Mr Abney (Jeff Rawle). He tells her that Mr Abney is a good man: he even took in a child refugee last year, but she ran away and stole from him. Stephanie is troubled by voices and visions of a dead girl clutching at her chest, and when Ben disappears she begins to suspect that all is not right in Aswarby House.<\/p> <p><i>The Treasure of Abbot-Thomas<\/i> - adapted by Jonathan Barnes<\/p> <p>When former Somerton school pupil Greg Parsbury (Robert Bathurst) meets history teacher Mika Chantry (Pearl Mackie) at a memorial service for schoolmaster Sam Abbot-Thomas, he begs for her help. He has been sent a postcard by the estate of the mysterious and charismatic Abbot-Thomas. On it is a strange inscription in Latin, which he believes to be an inaugural clue in a treasure hunt: much like the elaborate treasure hunts Abbot-Thomas used to set back in the 1970s. There were rumours that Abbot-Thomas possessed a hidden fortune, and Parsbury and Chantry set out to find it.<\/p> <p><i>A View from a Hill <\/i>- adapted by Mark Morris<\/p> <p>Comedian and podcaster Paul Fanshawe (Andy Nyman) and his wife, Sarah (Alice Lowe), visit the Cotswolds on holiday, trying to rebuild their lives after the death of their young son, Archie. Whilst out walking they spot a beautiful abbey across the valley on Gallows Hill, but when they reach it, they find the building is little more than rubble. While Sarah explores, Paul records commentary for his podcast. Sarah thinks she hears children\u2019s laughter, but there\u2019s no-one there. Later that night she listens back to the recording and hears a child\u2019s voice whisper, 'Mummy.' Sarah is convinced that Archie is trying to reach them and wants to return to the ruins. But something far worse is waiting for them on Gallows Hill.<\/p>","author":"M. R. James, Stephen Gallagher, A. K.

As Facebook spreads around the globe, it creates surprising effects - even becoming instrumental in political protests.<\/p><p>Veteran technology reporter David Kirkpatrick had the full cooperation of Facebook's key executives in researching this fascinating history. Kirkpatrick tells us how Facebook was created, why it has flourished, and where it is going next. He chronicles its successes and missteps, and gives readers the most complete assessment anywhere of founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, the central figure in the company's remarkable ascent. This is the Facebook story that can be found nowhere else.<\/p><p>Kirkpatrick shows how Zuckerberg refused to compromise, insistently focusing on growth over profits and preaching that Facebook must dominate (his word) communication on the Internet. In the process, he and a small group of key executives have created a company that has changed social life in the United States and elsewhere, a company that has become a ubiquitous presence in marketing, and one that has altered politics, business, and even our sense of our own identity. This is the Facebook Effect.<\/p><p>This special edition also includes an <b>exclusive conversation<\/b> between the author and Randi Zuckerberg, who offers unique insight as a marketer at Facebook and the CEO's sister.

<i>New York Times<\/i> best-selling author Brandon Sanderson, the Mistborn series is a heist story of political intrigue and magical, martial-arts action. <\/p> <p>For a thousand years the ash fell and no flowers bloomed. For a thousand years the Skaa slaved in misery and lived in fear. For a thousand years the Lord Ruler, the \"Sliver of Infinity,\" reigned with absolute power and ultimate terror, divinely invincible. Then, when hope was so long lost that not even its memory remained, a terribly scarred, heart-broken half-Skaa rediscovered it in the depths of the Lord Ruler's most hellish prison. <\/p> <p>Kelsier \"snapped\" and found in himself the powers of a Mistborn. A brilliant thief and natural leader, he turned his talents to the ultimate caper, with the Lord Ruler himself as the mark. Kelsier recruited the underworld's elite, the smartest and most trustworthy allomancers, each of whom shares one of his many powers, and all of whom relish a high-stakes challenge. Only then does he reveal his ultimate dream, not just the greatest heist in history, but the downfall of the divine despot. But even with the best criminal crew ever assembled, Kel's plan looks more like the ultimate long shot, until luck brings a ragged girl named Vin into his life. <\/p> <p>Like him, she's a half-Skaa orphan, but she's lived a much harsher life. Vin has learned to expect betrayal from everyone she meets, and gotten it. She will have to learn to trust, if Kel is to help her master powers of which she never dreamed. <\/p> <p>This saga dares to ask a simple question: What if the hero of prophecy fails?<\/p> <p>Other

number one <i>New York Times<\/i> best-selling author Brandon Sanderson, the Mistborn series is a heist story of political intrigue and magical, martial-arts action. <\/p> <p>Who is the Hero of Ages? <\/p> <p>To end the Final Empire and restore freedom, Vin killed the Lord Ruler. But as a result, the Deepness - the lethal form of the ubiquitous mists - is back, along with increasingly heavy ashfalls and ever more powerful earthquakes. Humanity appears to be doomed. <\/p> <p>Having escaped death at the climax of <i>The Well of Ascension<\/i> only by becoming a Mistborn himself, Emperor Elend Venture hopes to find clues left behind by the Lord Ruler that will allow him to save the world. Vin is consumed with guilt at having been tricked into releasing the mystic force known as Ruin from the Well. Ruin wants to end the world, and its near omniscience and ability to warp reality make stopping it seem impossible. She can't even discuss it with Elend, lest Ruin learn their plans! <\/p> <p>The conclusion of the Mistborn trilogy fulfills all the promise of the first two books. Revelations abound, connections rooted in early chapters of the series click into place, and surprises, as satisfying as they are stunning, blossom like fireworks to dazzle and delight. It all leads up to a finale unmatched for originality and audacity that will leave listeners shaking their heads in wonder, as if awaking from an amazing dream. <\/p> <p>Other Tor books by Brandon

Everyone says so. Except for my father; all he heard was Mother's sobs. Not of pain, but of joy, so he says. Other than that, the only verifiable fact about the day I was born is that an iceberg the size of Los Angeles broke free from the ice shelf, a few miles off the coast. Again, some would have me believe the fracture took place as I entered the world. But all that really matters, according to my parents, is that I, Solomon Ull Vincent, the first child born on Antarctica - the first and only Antarctican - was born on September 2, 1974.<\/p> <p>If only someone could have warned me that upon my return to the continent of my birth, 13 years later, I would be kidnapped, subjected to tortures beyond comprehension, and forced to fight...and kill. If only someone had hinted that I'd wind up struggling to survive in a subterranean world full of ancient warriors, strange creatures, and supernatural powers.<\/p> <p>Had I been warned, I might have lived a normal life. The human race might have remained safe. And the fate of the world might not rest on my shoulders. Had I been warned....<\/p> <p>This is my story - the tale of Solomon Ull Vincent - the last hunter.<\/p>","author":"Jeremy Robinson","image_url":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51xuvbTMchL._SL500_.jpg","title_short":"The Last Hunter: Collected Edition","rating_count":"3218","filename":"The Last Hunter- Collected Edition","download_link":"https://cds.audible.com/download?asin=B08R5FV95Q&cust_id=LaN4YPdMnexthpqfYKLbY_9FCJENugtKSyKhwginSnERrPqhE03NPfLb3xFjdA&codec=LC_64_22050_stereo&source=audible_iPhone&type=AUDI&encryptParams=YVkv1--kWRQ57jQw3UMFf6T24AhOpnWynhN9JN5Z4QWSn3CqWX8RO-iVTKPhVeRVJtj-AELdUeYm2lGWj4YVav0Yc9NOzknH4gIq0uLsMkmsMHk6xY6qNoIYEyCwCGW2bdcdb43bHyuyVbR3bVKcS13YBuO2jK1AhHQZpn8F93QlpoYo","release_date":"2020-12-29","user_id":"amzn1.account.AH36LR4NLVYTQFY3C2CQCATVAMDA","ayce":"false","publisher":"Breakneck Media","files":[{"path":"The Last Hunter- Collected Edition.jpg","kind":"image","type":"ART"},{"path":"The Last Hunter- Collected Edition.m4b","kind":"audio","type":"M4B"}],"asin":"B08R5FV95Q","region":"US","purchase_date":"2021-01-05"},{"copyright":"℗2014 Audible Inc.","rating_average":"4.261263985485334","chapters":[{"start_offset_ms":0,"length_ms":25767,"title":"Opening Credits","start_offset_sec":0},{"start_offset_ms":25767,"length_ms":4479978,"title":"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow","start_offset_sec":26},{"start_offset_ms":4505745,"length_ms":47456,"title":"End Credits","start_offset_sec":4506}],"abridged":"false","read_status":"Unread","description":"Tom Mison, star of the hit Fox series <i>Sleepy Hollow<\/i>, narrates the classic Washington Irving short story....","language":"english","title":"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow","info_link":"https://www.audible.com/pd/B00N0ETQO4","duration":"01:15:00","author_link":"https://www.audible.com/author/Washington+Irving/B000APWRJC","seconds":4500,"narrated_by":"Tom Mison","product_id":"BK_ADBL_017837","genre":"Literature & Fiction:Classics","key":"BK_ADBL_017837","summary":"<p>Tom Mison, star of the hit Fox series <i>Sleepy Hollow<\/i>, narrates the classic Washington Irving short story. <\/p> <p>In the secluded Dutch territory of Sleepy Hollow, nebbish schoolmaster Ichabod Crane competes with the town hero for the hand of Katrina Van Tassel, the 18-year-old daughter and sole child of a wealthy farmer.

They have food, weapons, top-notch gear, and connections in the darkest holes of the special operations community. Just don't cross them, because hell hath no fury like the Maguires.<br /> <br /> Conor Maguire nearly lost his daughter when she was three years old, injured by the drunk driver who killed his wife. When the justice system failed him, Conor retaliated against the driver in dramatic and gruesome fashion.<br /> <br /> An ironclad alibi prevented the police from pinning the murder on Conor.

The AI has been deleted, but the message it sent out into the abyss of space in search of a companion has been answered. An alien force dwarfing the Earth is on its way to find out why the AI has stopped communicating. Keats and company can only assume its intentions will be hostile when it finds out the truth.<\/p> <p>4. <i>Human Plus<\/i> <\/p> <p><i>Human Plus<\/i> is the fourth story in the smash hit science-fiction series.

Robert V. S. Redick has been compared to Philip Pullman, George R. R. Martin, and China Miéville, among others, and like them he is a spellbinding storyteller, unafraid to sail his imagination into uncharted waters. With <i>The Red Wolf Conspiracy<\/i> he launches the first book of a trilogy destined to take its place among the classics of epic fantasy. <p>The Imperial Merchant Ship <i>Chathrand<\/i> is the last of her kind. Six hundred years old, the secrets of her construction long forgotten, the massive vessel dwarfs every other sailing craft in the world. It is a palace with sails, a floating outpost of the Empire of Arqual. And it is on its most vital mission yet: to deliver a young woman whose marriage will seal the peace between Arqual and its mortal enemy, the secretive Mzithrin Empire. <\/p> <p>But the young woman in question - Thasha, the daughter of the Arquali ambassador - has no intention of going meekly to the altar. For the ship's true mission is not peace but war - a war that threatens to unleash an ancient, all-consuming evil.<\/p> <p>As the dark conspiracy at the heart of the voyage unfurls, Pazel Pathkendle, a lowly tarboy with an uncanny gift, will find himself in an unlikely alliance with Thasha and her protectors: Hercól, a valet who is more than he appears; Dri, the queen of a race of tiny stowaways who have their own plans for the great ship; and Ramachni, a powerful sorcerer from another world. Arrayed against them are the <i>Chathrand<\/i>'s brutal captain, Nilus Rose; the Emperor's spymaster and chief assassin, Sandor Ott; and the enigmatic Dr. Chadfallow, a longtime friend to Pazel's family whose kind words may hide a vicious betrayal.<\/p> <p>As the <i>Chathrand<\/i> navigates treacherous waters to complete its mission, Pazel, Thasha, and their allies - including a singularly heroic rat - must also navigate a treacherous web of in...<\/p>","author":"Robert V.

Their honor will be bought in blood and pain. The Camp Ryder Hub is broken. Lee is nowhere to be found, and his allies are scattered across the state, each of them learning that their missions will not be as easy as they thought. Inside the walls of Camp Ryder, a silent war is brewing, between those few that still support Lee's vision of rebuilding, and the majority that support Jerry's desire for isolation. But this war will not remain silent for long. And in this savage world, everyone will have to make a choice. To keep their morals. Or keep their lives.<\/p>","author":"D. J.

It is for mature audiences only. Just like the original graphic novels, this audio adaptation contains explicit language and graphic violence, as well as strong sexual content and themes. Discretion is advised.<\/b><\/p> <p>Hailed by the <i>Los Angeles Times Magazine<\/i> as \u201cthe greatest epic in the history of comic books\u201d, <i>The Sandman <\/i>changed the game with its dark, literary world of fantasy and horror - creating a global, cultural phenomenon in the process. At long last, Audible and DC present the first-ever audio production of the<i> New York Times<\/i> best-selling series written by acclaimed storyteller Neil Gaiman (who also serves as co-executive producer). Adapted and directed by multi-award-winner (and frequent Gaiman collaborator) Dirk Maggs, and performed by an ensemble cast with James McAvoy (<i>It, Parts One and Two, X-Men: First Class, Split<\/i>) in the title role, this first installment of a multi-part original audio series will transport you to a world that re-writes the rules of audio entertainment the way that <i>The Sandman<\/i> originally re-defined the graphic novel.<\/p> <p>When The Sandman, also known as Lord Morpheus - the immortal king of dreams, stories and the imagination - is pulled from his realm and imprisoned on Earth by a nefarious cult, he languishes for decades before finally escaping. Once free, he must retrieve the three \u201ctools\u201d that will restore his power and help him to rebuild his dominion, which has deteriorated in his absence. As the multi-threaded story unspools, The Sandman descends into Hell to confront Lucifer (Michael Sheen), chases rogue nightmares who have escaped his realm, and crosses paths with an array of characters from DC comic books, ancient myths, and real-world history, including: Inmates of Gotham City's Arkham Asylum, Doctor Destiny, the muse Calliope, the three Fates, William Shakespeare (Arthur Darvill), and many more.<\/p> <p>A powerhouse supporting cast helps translate this masterwork into a sonic experience worthy of its legacy, including Riz Ahmed, Kat Dennings, Taron Egerton, Samantha Morton, Bebe Neuwirth, Andy Serkis, and more. Setting the stage for their performance is an unprecedented cinematic soundscape featuring an original musical score by British Academy Award winner James Hannigan. Fans will especially revel in a new twist for the audio adaptation: Neil Gaiman himself serves as the narrator. Follow him as he leads listeners along a winding path of myths, imagination and, often, terror. Even in your wildest dreams, you\u2019ve never heard anything like this.<\/p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.<\/b><\/p>","author":"Neil Gaiman, Dirk Maggs","image_url":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61CEI+8TpdL._SL500_.jpg","title_short":"The Sandman","rating_count":"52878","download_link":"https://cds.audible.com/download?asin=B086WP794Z&cust_id=TKQ-8-bQzCrFigcVBZ9qjrbUFH_HnAlwmpm0NKWpohNxnW3x9iUcSl5XY2EX0w&codec=LC_128_44100_stereo&source=audible_iPhone&type=AUDI&encryptParams=sXBDy_SB7uL9N91hUUeB97EsOmVhbCOXPxR_IhfqR1IbBdYb1kYOnRBKfxOoVd1Af_dvpMSfZYfzAC-oURdtYiZ7kXeTxvEue_uRneCG0cOPk4tiZ9cFQGVh9khdtTjXQ4-BejJy066GvykpYZWCUhG6FKk0V_XIfJrXtsWoTVl85Uav","filename":"The Sandman","release_date":"2020-07-15","user_id":"amzn1.account.AH36LR4NLVYTQFY3C2CQCATVAMDA","ayce":"false","publisher":"Audible Originals","files":[{"path":"The Sandman.jpg","kind":"image","type":"ART"}],"asin":"B086WP794Z","region":"US","purchase_date":"2021-01-05"},{"copyright":"©2017 Jenna Moreci;℗2019 Jenna Moreci","rating_average":"4.346052631578948","chapters":[{"start_offset_ms":0,"length_ms":10959,"title":"Opening Credits","start_offset_sec":0},{"start_offset_ms":10959,"length_ms":479956,"title":"Chapter 1","start_offset_sec":11},{"start_offset_ms":490915,"length_ms":2008990,"title":"Chapter 2","start_offset_sec":491},{"start_offset_ms":2499905,"length_ms":2256561,"title":"Chapter 3","start_offset_sec":2500},{"start_offset_ms":4756466,"length_ms":4836716,"title":"Chapter 4","start_offset_sec":4756},{"start_offset_ms":9593182,"length_ms":2080833,"title":"Chapter 5","start_offset_sec":9593},{"start_offset_ms":11674015,"length_ms":2133913,"title":"Chapter 6","start_offset_sec":11674},{"start_offset_ms":13807928,"length_ms":1600783,"title":"Chapter 7","start_offset_sec":13808},{"start_offset_ms":15408711,"length_ms":2759691,"title":"Chapter 8","start_offset_sec":15409},{"start_offset_ms":18168402,"length_ms":2436098,"title":"Chapter 9","start_offset_sec":18168},{"start_offset_ms":20604500,"length_ms":4920261,"title":"Chapter 10","start_offset_sec":20605},{"start_offset_ms":25524761,"length_ms":3636337,"title":"Chapter 11","start_offset_sec":25525},{"start_offset_ms":29161098,"length_ms":3305592,"title":"Chapter 12","start_offset_sec":29161},{"start_offset_ms":32466690,"length_ms":1625025,"title":"Chapter 13","start_offset_sec":32467},{"start_offset_ms":34091715,"length_ms":2618978,"title":"Chapter 14","start_offset_sec":34092},{"start_offset_ms":36710693,"length_ms":1834097,"title":"Chapter 15","start_offset_sec":36711},{"start_offset_ms":38544790,"length_ms":2420633,"title":"Chapter 16","start_offset_sec":38545},{"start_offset_ms":40965423,"length_ms":1414745,"title":"Chapter 17","start_offset_sec":40965},{"start_offset_ms":42380168,"length_ms":4219112,"title":"Chapter 18","start_offset_sec":42380},{"start_offset_ms":46599280,"length_ms":2127505,"title":"Chapter 19","start_offset_sec":46599},{"start_offset_ms":48726785,"length_ms":2722446,"title":"Chapter 20","start_offset_sec":48727},{"start_offset_ms":51449231,"length_ms":3125684,"title":"Chapter 21","start_offset_sec":51449},{"start_offset_ms":54574915,"length_ms":1307469,"title":"Chapter 22","start_offset_sec":54575},{"start_offset_ms":55882384,"length_ms":2237196,"title":"Chapter 23","start_offset_sec":55882},{"start_offset_ms":58119580,"length_ms":2537615,"title":"Chapter 24","start_offset_sec":58120},{"start_offset_ms":60657195,"length_ms":2293527,"title":"Chapter 25","start_offset_sec":60657},{"start_offset_ms":62950722,"length_ms":2435215,"title":"Chapter 26","start_offset_sec":62951},{"start_offset_ms":65385937,"length_ms":3856370,"title":"Chapter 27","start_offset_sec":65386},{"start_offset_ms":69242307,"length_ms":2934862,"title":"Chapter 28","start_offset_sec":69242},{"start_offset_ms":72177169,"length_ms":2028077,"title":"Chapter 29","start_offset_sec":72177},{"start_offset_ms":74205246,"length_ms":21314,"title":"End Credits","start_offset_sec":74205}],"series_link":"/pd/The-Saviors-Series-Audiobook/B08WJH4R31","abridged":"false","read_status":"Unread","description":"<p>Tobias Kaya doesn't care about The Savior.

The dictatorial Augurs, once thought of almost as gods, were overthrown and wiped out during the conflict, their much-feared powers mysteriously failing them. Those who had ruled under them, men and women with a lesser ability known as the Gift, avoided the Augurs' fate only by submitting themselves to the rebellion's Four Tenets. <\/p> <p>A representation of these laws is now written into the flesh of any who use the Gift, forcing those so marked into absolute obedience. As a student of the Gifted, Davian suffers the consequences of a war fought--and lost--before he was born. Despised by most beyond the school walls, he and those around him are all but prisoners as they attempt to learn control of the Gift. Worse, as Davian struggles with his lessons, he knows there is further to fall if he cannot pass his final tests. But when he discovers he has the ability to wield the forbidden power of the Augurs, he sets into motion a chain of events that will change everything. <\/p> <p>To the north an ancient enemy, long thought defeated, begins to stir.

Department laboratory and a million casual contacts that form the links in a chain letter of death.<\/p> <p>And here is the bleak new world of the day after: a world stripped of its institutions and emptied of 99 percent of its people. A world in which a handful of panicky survivors choose sides - or are chosen. A world in which good rides on the frail shoulders of the 108-year-old Mother Abagail - and the worst nightmares of evil are embodied in a man with a lethal smile and unspeakable powers: Randall Flagg, the dark man.<\/p> <p>In 1978, Stephen King published <i>The Stand<\/i>, the novel that is now considered to be one of his finest works. But as it was first published, <i>The Stand<\/i> was incomplete, since more than 150,000 words had been cut from the original manuscript.<\/p> <p>Now Stephen King's apocalyptic vision of a world blasted by plague and embroiled in an elemental struggle between good and evil has been restored to its entirety. <i>The Stand: The Complete and Uncut Edition<\/i> includes material previously deleted, along with new material that King added as he reworked the manuscript for a new generation. It gives us new characters and endows familiar ones with new depths. It has a new beginning and a new ending. What emerges is a gripping work with the scope and moral complexity of a true epic.<\/p> <p>For hundreds of thousands of fans who heard <i>The Stand<\/i> in its original version and wanted more, this new edition is Stephen King's gift. And those who are listening to <i>The Stand<\/i> for the first time will discover a triumphant and eerily plausible work of the imagination that takes on the issues that will determine our survival.<\/p> <p>Cover artwork ©2020 CBS Interactive Inc.<\/p>","author":"Stephen King","image_url":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41WNRIBlxJL._SL500_.jpg","title_short":"The Stand","rating_count":"78320","filename":"The Stand","download_link":"https://cds.audible.com/download?asin=B0077DEH7A&cust_id=eMsh00nWCOas7Ggc7x6kFu3TzRtZkGi071_bw_J7drT4zfB4l4cdz4ZmGlN22A&codec=LC_64_22050_stereo&source=audible_iPhone&type=AUDI&encryptParams=5e70Fhb6uma9lExC9md6jARIuN5y30HbwzM9uUUAdEi3el57HxhHh5AhjzjczTPsUUjgiTk7LSsAdtb2KDMKz560IrxN4dB4ba-xY4zKxfPxmnCAf7DEFYBGqFn2Di7LRcTqXyIeBC5f-0DSH_8UGgpbUqkshpZfbLHZezXWSAJc2-gB","release_date":"2012-02-14","user_id":"amzn1.account.AH36LR4NLVYTQFY3C2CQCATVAMDA","ayce":"false","publisher":"Random House Audio","files":[{"path":"The Stand.jpg","kind":"image","type":"ART"},{"path":"The Stand.m4b","kind":"audio","type":"M4B"}],"asin":"B0077DEH7A","region":"US","purchase_date":"2014-11-08"},{"copyright":"©2008 David Morrell;℗2011 Brilliance Audio, Inc.","rating_average":"4.375","chapters":[{"start_offset_ms":0,"length_ms":1157561,"title":"Chapter 1","start_offset_sec":0},{"start_offset_ms":1157561,"length_ms":1039232,"title":"Chapter 2","start_offset_sec":1158},{"start_offset_ms":2196793,"length_ms":1011136,"title":"Chapter 3","start_offset_sec":2197},{"start_offset_ms":3207929,"length_ms":1451897,"title":"Chapter 4","start_offset_sec":3208},{"start_offset_ms":4659826,"length_ms":1035424,"title":"Chapter 5","start_offset_sec":4660},{"start_offset_ms":5695250,"length_ms":991724,"title":"Chapter 6","start_offset_sec":5695},{"start_offset_ms":6686974,"length_ms":1169450,"title":"Chapter 7","start_offset_sec":6687},{"start_offset_ms":7856424,"length_ms":1477021,"title":"Chapter 8","start_offset_sec":7856},{"start_offset_ms":9333445,"length_ms":888628,"title":"Chapter 9","start_offset_sec":9333},{"start_offset_ms":10222073,"length_ms":946074,"title":"Chapter 10","start_offset_sec":10222},{"start_offset_ms":11168147,"length_ms":1358460,"title":"Chapter 11","start_offset_sec":11168},{"start_offset_ms":12526607,"length_ms":1334126,"title":"Chapter 12","start_offset_sec":12527},{"start_offset_ms":13860733,"length_ms":1302221,"title":"Chapter 13","start_offset_sec":13861},{"start_offset_ms":15162954,"length_ms":735376,"title":"Chapter 14","start_offset_sec":15163},{"start_offset_ms":15898330,"length_ms":778008,"title":"Chapter 15","start_offset_sec":15898},{"start_offset_ms":16676338,"length_ms":865547,"title":"Chapter 16","start_offset_sec":16676},{"start_offset_ms":17541885,"length_ms":815949,"title":"Chapter 17","start_offset_sec":17542},{"start_offset_ms":18357834,"length_ms":1468430,"title":"Chapter 18","start_offset_sec":18358},{"start_offset_ms":19826264,"length_ms":1289915,"title":"Chapter 19","start_offset_sec":19826},{"start_offset_ms":21116179,"length_ms":1149620,"title":"Chapter 20","start_offset_sec":21116},{"start_offset_ms":22265799,"length_ms":1147809,"title":"Chapter 21","start_offset_sec":22266},{"start_offset_ms":23413608,"length_ms":1266741,"title":"Chapter 22","start_offset_sec":23414},{"start_offset_ms":24680349,"length_ms":1263491,"title":"Chapter 23","start_offset_sec":24680},{"start_offset_ms":25943840,"length_ms":1226199,"title":"Chapter 24","start_offset_sec":25944},{"start_offset_ms":27170039,"length_ms":1363336,"title":"Chapter 25","start_offset_sec":27170},{"start_offset_ms":28533375,"length_ms":1167732,"title":"Chapter 26","start_offset_sec":28533},{"start_offset_ms":29701107,"length_ms":1227871,"title":"Chapter 27","start_offset_sec":29701},{"start_offset_ms":30928978,"length_ms":603162,"title":"Chapter 28","start_offset_sec":30929}],"abridged":"false","read_status":"Unread","description":"David Morrell, bestselling author of <i>First Blood<\/i>, <i>The Brotherhood of the Rose<\/i> and <i>The Fifth Profession<\/i>, distills four decades of writing and publishing experience into this single masterwork of advice....","language":"english","title":"The Successful Novelist","info_link":"https://www.audible.com/pd/B004RC9LI4","duration":"08:45:00","author_link":"https://www.audible.com/author/David+Morrell/B000APAKHI","seconds":31500,"narrated_by":"Patrick Lawlor","product_id":"BK_BRLL_002782","genre":"Education & Learning:Words, Language & Grammar","key":"BK_BRLL_002782","summary":"<p>David Morrell, best-selling author of <i>First Blood<\/i>, <i>The Brotherhood of the Rose<\/i> and <i>The Fifth Profession<\/i>, distills four decades of writing and publishing experience into this single masterwork of advice and instruction for fiction writers looking to make it big in the publishing world.

Archive, begins an incredible new saga of epic proportion.<\/p> <p>Roshar is a world of stone and storms. Uncanny tempests of incredible power sweep across the rocky terrain so frequently that they have shaped ecology and civilization alike. Animals hide in shells, trees pull in branches, and grass retracts into the soilless ground. Cities are built only where the topography offers shelter.<\/p> <p>It has been centuries since the fall of the 10 consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant, but their Shardblades and Shardplate remain: mystical swords and suits of armor that transform ordinary men into near-invincible warriors. Men trade kingdoms for Shardblades. Wars were fought for them and won by them.<\/p> <p>One such war rages on a ruined landscape called the Shattered Plains. There, Kaladin, who traded his medical apprenticeship for a spear to protect his little brother, has been reduced to slavery. In a war that makes no sense, where 10 armies fight separately against a single foe, he struggles to save his men and to fathom the leaders who consider them expendable.<\/p> <p>Brightlord Dalinar Kholin commands one of those other armies. Like his brother, the late king, he is fascinated by an ancient text called The Way of Kings. Troubled by over-powering visions of ancient times and the Knights Radiant, he has begun to doubt his own sanity.<\/p> <p>Across the ocean, an untried young woman named Shallan seeks to train under an eminent scholar and notorious heretic, Dalinar's niece, Jasnah. Though she genuinely loves learning, Shallan's motives are less than pure. As she plans a daring theft, her research for Jasnah hints at secrets of the Knights Radiant and the true cause of the war.<\/p> <p>The result of more than 10 years of planning, writing, and world-building, <i>The Way of Kings<\/i> is but the opening movement of the Stormlight Archive, a bold masterpiece in the making.<\/p> <p>Speak again the ancient oaths:<\/p> <p>Life before death.<\/p> <p>Strength before weakness.<\/p> <p>Journey before destination.<\/p> <p>And return to men the Shards they once bore.<\/p> <p>The Knights Radiant must stand again.<\/p> <p>Other Tor books by Brandon

number one <i>New York Times<\/i> best-selling author Brandon Sanderson, the Mistborn series is a heist story of political intrigue and magical martial-arts action. <\/p> <p>The impossible has been accomplished. The Lord Ruler - the man who claimed to be god incarnate and brutally ruled the world for a thousand years - has been vanquished. But Kelsier, the hero who masterminded that triumph, is dead too, and now the awesome task of building a new world has been left to his young protégé, Vin, the former street urchin who is now the most powerful Mistborn in the land, and to the idealistic young nobleman she loves. <\/p> <p>As Kelsier's protégé and slayer of the Lord Ruler she is now venerated by a budding new religion, a distinction that makes her intensely uncomfortable. Even more worrying, the mists have begun behaving strangely since the Lord Ruler died, and seem to harbor a strange vaporous entity that haunts her.<\/p> <p>Stopping assassins may keep Vin's Mistborn skills sharp, but it's the least of her problems.<\/p> <p>Luthadel, the largest city of the former empire, doesn't run itself, and Vin and the other members of Kelsier's crew, who lead the revolution, must learn a whole new set of practical and political skills to help. It certainly won't get easier with three armies - one of them composed of ferocious giants - now vying to conquer the city, and no sign of the Lord Ruler's hidden cache of atium, the rarest and most powerful allomantic metal.<\/p> <p>As the siege of Luthadel tightens, an ancient legend seems to offer a glimmer of hope. But even if it really exists, no one knows where to find the Well of Ascension or what manner of power it bestows. <\/p> <p>Other Tor books by Brandon Sanderson:<\/p> <ul> <li><i>The Cosmere<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Stormlight Archive<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Way of Kings<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Words of Radiance<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Edgedancer <\/i>(Novella)<\/li> <li><i>Oathbringer <\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>The Mistborn trilogy<\/p> <ul> <li><i>Mistborn: The Final Empire<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Well of Ascension<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Hero of Ages<\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>Mistborn: The Wax and Wayne series:<\/p> <ul> <li><i>Alloy of Law<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Shadows of Self<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Bands of Mourning<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Collection<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Arcanum Unbounded<\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>Other Cosmere novels:<\/p> <ul> <li><i>Elantris<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Warbreaker<\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>The Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians series:<\/p> <ul> <li><i>Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Scrivener's Bones<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Knights of Crystallia<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Shattered Lens<\/i><\/li> <li><i>The Dark Talent<\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>The Rithmatist series:<\/p> <ul> <li><i>The Rithmatist<\/i><\/li> <\/ul> <p>Other books by Brandon Sanderson:<\/p> <ul> <li><i>The Reckoners<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Steelheart<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Firefight<\/i><\/li> <li><i>Calamity <\/i><\/li> <\/ul>","author":"Brandon Sanderson","image_url":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61jTUT0xfCL._SL500_.jpg","title_short":"The Well of Ascension","rating_count":"70869","filename":"The Well of Ascension - Mistborn, Book 2","download_link":"https://cds.audible.com/download?asin=B002V5GLQ4&cust_id=3FEO8gYxNZgBa_3p4dgi3OO51O-PPwOWZDjT5uuE-Odftf3JZFPQCC3PsgoAIw&codec=LC_64_22050_stereo&source=audible_iPhone&type=AUDI&encryptParams=XZjhXkYNDSLWH2LqHBWIMXYl_E2OwnG-6W4zws8E50dvLDPUDqfuuMdZRYjrgtCMX0vCc1sNvWpXVAEva_ZDojRX86jLYEUwFA4GAwRpmqYX_EdWrIKw_LTsPHwCfrZaO9wKlKjC6XkhajOa_clB8EveqamjhOWL9cZooEM0ov--eh0v","release_date":"2008-12-28","user_id":"amzn1.account.AH36LR4NLVYTQFY3C2CQCATVAMDA","ayce":"false","publisher":"Macmillan Audio","files":[{"path":"The Well of Ascension - Mistborn, Book 2.jpg","kind":"image","type":"ART"},{"path":"The Well of Ascension - Mistborn, Book 2.m4b","kind":"audio","type":"M4B"}],"asin":"B002V5GLQ4","region":"US","purchase_date":"2014-02-14"},{"copyright":"©2004 Jasper Fforde ℗2012 Penguin","rating_average":"4.554885404101327","chapters":[{"start_offset_ms":0,"length_ms":14474,"title":"Opening Credits","start_offset_sec":0},{"start_offset_ms":14474,"length_ms":1745784,"title":"1.

It\u2019s fortunate that they have Oberon the Irish Wolfhound on their side\u2014but is one good dog going to be enough to see them through it?<br /> <br /> <b>Don\u2019t miss any of The Iron Druid Chronicles:<\/b><br /> <b>HOUNDED | HEXED | HAMMERED | TRICKED | TRAPPED | HUNTED | SHATTERED | STAKED | SCOURGED | BESIEGED<\/b><\/p>","author":"Kevin Hearne","image_url":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61O59uqF2cL._SL500_.jpg","title_short":"Trapped","rating_count":"12299","download_link":"https://cds.audible.com/download?asin=B009PRHPMU&cust_id=kkvOnJ2JGbLmiMaJlF1kdv7VgX7B6uTaPEcvIkxRAhGULqsChoWNPUYZ3xaGxw&codec=LC_64_22050_stereo&source=audible_iPhone&type=AUDI&encryptParams=oiIWWOH0moqWEGXoUv8zV2A_gCllAePSeBJN3oMLsD5G4SQyh7l3HyM-1UNsUVsSgCG2EjERUEh_bKLRlJBoTse0EHJQ8YespZ4jeXpZvgv6ZBzhBLFZ199zgCBve-Jy8u1CrogPVUfBay0jgq_kKrP9m0S4nxDC6dTxBSjk7cR4SucG","filename":"Trapped - The Iron Druid Chronicles, Book 5","release_date":"2012-11-27","user_id":"amzn1.account.AH36LR4NLVYTQFY3C2CQCATVAMDA","ayce":"false","publisher":"Random House Audio","files":[{"path":"Trapped - The Iron Druid Chronicles, Book 5.jpg","kind":"image","type":"ART"}],"asin":"B009PRHPMU","region":"US","purchase_date":"2015-02-26"},{"copyright":"©2015 Hollan Publishing, Inc. ℗2015 Audible Inc.","rating_average":"4.679814385150812","chapters":[{"start_offset_ms":0,"length_ms":18104,"title":"Opening Credits","start_offset_sec":0},{"start_offset_ms":18104,"length_ms":415644,"title":"Chapter 1: Lost Friends","start_offset_sec":18},{"start_offset_ms":433748,"length_ms":435374,"title":"Chapter 2: Respawn","start_offset_sec":434},{"start_offset_ms":869122,"length_ms":452046,"title":"Chapter 3: Surrender Slime","start_offset_sec":869},{"start_offset_ms":1321168,"length_ms":334460,"title":"Chapter 4: Views and Villains","start_offset_sec":1321},{"start_offset_ms":1655628,"length_ms":427804,"title":"Chapter 5: Portals","start_offset_sec":1656},{"start_offset_ms":2083432,"length_ms":405095,"title":"Chapter 6: It\u2019s Not an Ending","start_offset_sec":2083},{"start_offset_ms":2488527,"length_ms":341891,"title":"Chapter 7: The Return","start_offset_sec":2489},{"start_offset_ms":2830418,"length_ms":501923,"title":"Chapter 8: Nether Again","start_offset_sec":2830},{"start_offset_ms":3332341,"length_ms":402123,"title":"Chapter 9: Loot and Lava","start_offset_sec":3332},{"start_offset_ms":3734464,"length_ms":432216,"title":"Chapter 10: Under the Sea","start_offset_sec":3734},{"start_offset_ms":4166680,"length_ms":425018,"title":"Chapter 11: Mining Fatigue","start_offset_sec":4167},{"start_offset_ms":4591698,"length_ms":326983,"title":"Chapter 12: A Blast from the Past","start_offset_sec":4592},{"start_offset_ms":4918681,"length_ms":335435,"title":"Chapter 13: Treasure Hunt","start_offset_sec":4919},{"start_offset_ms":5254116,"length_ms":256023,"title":"Chapter 14: Sweet as Sugar","start_offset_sec":5254},{"start_offset_ms":5510139,"length_ms":433888,"title":"Chapter 15: Dunes in the Desert","start_offset_sec":5510},{"start_offset_ms":5944027,"length_ms":418145,"title":"Chapter 16: It\u2019s Not a Mirage","start_offset_sec":5944},{"start_offset_ms":6362172,"length_ms":557279,"title":"Chapter 17: Treasures and Troubles","start_offset_sec":6362},{"start_offset_ms":6919451,"length_ms":147291,"title":"Chapter 18: Rewards","start_offset_sec":6919},{"start_offset_ms":7066742,"length_ms":35961,"title":"End Credits","start_offset_sec":7067}],"series_link":"/pd/An-Unofficial-Gamers-Adventure-Audiobook/B011QA90RG","abridged":"false","read_status":"Unread","description":"In this fourth installment of the Minecraft Gamer's Adventure series, Steve receives a distress call from his friends Max, Lucy, and Henry....","language":"english","title":"Treasure Hunters in Trouble - An Unofficial Gamer\u2019s Adventure, Book 4","info_link":"https://www.audible.com/pd/B00V3MAAY0","duration":"01:58:00","author_link":"https://www.audible.com/author/Winter+Morgan/B00MSJMH0W","seconds":7080,"narrated_by":"Luke Daniels","product_id":"BK_ADBL_022879","genre":"Children's Audiobooks:Activities & Hobbies","series_name":"An Unofficial Gamer's Adventure","series_sequence":"4","key":"BK_ADBL_022879","summary":"<p>In this fourth installment of the Minecraft Gamer's Adventure series, Steve receives a distress call from his friends Max, Lucy, and Henry.

With the H1N1 virus running rampant throughout the country, people lined up in droves to try and attain one of the coveted vaccines. What was not known was the effect this largely untested, rushed to market, inoculation was to have on the unsuspecting throngs. Within days, feverish folk throughout the country convulsed, collapsed, and died, only to be reborn. With a taste for brains, blood, and bodies, these modern-day zombies scoured the lands for their next meal. Overnight the country became a killing ground for the hordes of zombies that ravaged the land. <\/p> <p>This is the story of Michael Talbot, his family, and his friends: a band of ordinary people trying to get by in extraordinary times. When disaster strikes, Mike, a self-proclaimed survivalist, does his best to ensure the safety and security of those he cares for. Book one of the Zombie Fallout Trilogy follows our lead character at his self-deprecating, sarcastic best. What he encounters along the way leads him down a long dark road, always skirting the edge of insanity. <\/p> <p>Can he keep his family safe? Can he discover the secret behind Tommy's powers? Can he save anyone from the zombie queen? Encircled in a seemingly safe haven called Little Turtle, Mike and his family, together with the remnants of a tattered community, must fight against a relentless, ruthless, unstoppable force. This last bastion of civilization has made its final stand.
