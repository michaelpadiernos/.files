If eza does something unexpected, or its output looks wrong, or it displays an error on the screen, or if it outright crashes, then please include the following information in your report:

- The version of eza being used (`eza --version`)
- The command-line arguments you are using
- Your operating system and hardware platform

If it’s a crash, please include the full text of the crash that gets printed to the screen. If you’re seeing unexpected behaviour, a screenshot of the issue will help a lot.
